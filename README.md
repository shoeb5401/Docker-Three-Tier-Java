├── docker-compose.yml
├── backend/                     # Java Maven Spring Boot application
│   └── Dockerfile               # Builds java-app\:v1 image
└── README.md

```

## 🚀 Features

- Java Spring Boot backend (exposed at port `8080`)
- MySQL Database (exposed at port `3306`)
- Health checks for service stability
- Interconnected through Docker network

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

| Variable Name               | Description                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`    | JDBC connection string      |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME` | MySQL root user             |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` | MySQL root password         |

---

## 🐳 Docker Setup

### 🔧 1. Build the Backend Image

```bash
cd backend/
docker build -t java-app:v1 .
````

### ▶️ 2. Start the Services

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 🔁 3. Stop the Services

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## 🧪 Health Check Endpoints

* **Backend (Spring Boot):** `http://localhost:8080/actuator/health`
* **MySQL:** Internal `mysqladmin ping`

---

## 📦 Volumes & Persistence

* MySQL data is persisted using the `mysql-data` named volume.

---

## 🌐 Network

* Custom Docker network `expenses-app-nw` ensures isolated communication between services.

---

## 📜 Notes

* `depends_on.condition: service_healthy` ensures the app starts only when MySQL is ready.
* Ensure port `8080` and `3306` are free before running.

---

## 🧹 Cleanup

To remove containers, network, and volumes:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

```
